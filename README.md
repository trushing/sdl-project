# sdl-project
This is a very old project from 2013 made while trying out SDL when still somewhat new to programming. All it really does is render a tilemap that lets you turn white tiles to green or vice versa by right-clicking. It also creates a circle that you can select by left clicking, and move to different tiles by right clicking with the circle selected. Pressing 'N' creates new circles.
